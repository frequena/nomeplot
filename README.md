# NOMePlot - A Webtool for the analysis of NOMe and Bisulfite data

[Link to the app](https://landeiralab.shinyapps.io/nomeplot/)

NOMePlot is a webtool that facilitates the analysis of Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome (NOMe) and Bisulfite (BS) sequencing data generated using Sanger or High-throughput sequencing (NOMe-PCR, NOMe-seq, BS-PCR and BS-seq).

This web application is easy to use and does not required bioinformatic skills. Input sequences for sanger sequencing analysis must be provided in fasta format while input data for high-throughput sequencing must be provided as a bam file. The user-interface is self-explanatory.

NOMePlot has been developed with R/Bioconductor packages and Shiny. Source code for local installation is available from GitHub.

NOMePlot operates under the GNU General Public License version 3.
