Instructions to use NOMe-seq example data
------------------------------------------

NOMePlot is design to produce single molecule analysis of genomic regions of interest upon inspection of NOMe-seq data in a Genome viewer. 

1. Establishing the genomic region of interest using IGV
--------------------------------------------------------
1.1. Open the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to browse the attached bam file and establish the genomic regions of interest. IGV can be freely downloaded from the broad institute at http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/.
1.2. Select "Human hg19" genome and upload the attached bam file. 
1.3. In the search box type the gene name "i.e. RNF216" to move to this genomic region. Please, note that the loaded bam file contains only reads mapped to a region of Chromosome 7 (from 5,314,680 to 5,822,336 bp)
1.4. Use the zoom tool to visualize a region of less than 2000 bp. We recommend selecting regions of around 600 bps with good read coverage (i.e. Exon1 of RNF216 - chr7:5,820,779-5,821,292).

Please, note that reads that do not entirely map to the selected genomic interval will not be analysed by NOMePlot.


2. Single molecule analysis using NOMePlot
-------------------------------------------

Use your web browser to go to NOMePlot main screen at https://landeiralab.shinyapps.io/nomeplot/

1. Click on "High-throughput sequencing" on the left panel.
2. Click on "NOMe-treated" on the left panel.
3. Click on "Browse" on the "Problem sequences" panel and upload the attached BAM file. 
4. Select "hg19 (Homo sapiens)" genomic assembly on "Reference sequence" panel. 
5. Choose Chromosome 7 on "Reference sequence" panel. 
6. Copy and paste the genomic interval coordinates into the "Genomic Interval - Start/End" boxes (i.e. Start: 5,820,779 End: 5,821,292).
7. Click on Start analysis to visualize the results.
8. Arrange sequences by adjusting the clustering window to 140 bp in the "Arrange sequences" panel.
9. Click on "Download Genome-wide analysis" or " Download Lollipop graphic (.svg format)" to obtain analysis files.


Note: The attached example bam file has been extracted from GEO Accession number: GSM1001125.
