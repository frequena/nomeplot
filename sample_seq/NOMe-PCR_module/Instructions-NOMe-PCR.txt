Instructions to use NOMe-PCR example data
------------------------------------------

Use your web browser to go to NOMePlot main screen at https://landeiralab.shinyapps.io/nomeplot

1. Click on "Sanger sequencing" on the left menu. 
2. Click on "NOMe-treated" on the left menu.  
3. Click on "Browse" on the "Reference genomic sequence" box and upload the genomic sequence "Wnt1-Reference-Genomic.txt"
4. Click on "Browse" on the "NOMe-treated sequences" box, select the sixteen NOMe-treated sequences for Wnt1 gene and upload them. 
5. Lollipop graphic, heatmap and linechart analysis should already be visible on the right panel. 
6. Arrange sequences by adjusting the clustering window to 140 bp in the "Arrange sequences" panel.
7. On the "Personalize Lollipop graphic" panel:
	-Mark "Yes" on the "Identify nucleosome occupied regions" option to draw red lines to represent the regions occupied by a nucleosome.
	-Mark "Yes" on the "Label TSS" option to type the position of TSS calculated from the start of the sequence (Wnt1 TSS position= 223).
	-If desire, personalize lollipop graphic colors.
8. Click on "Download NOMe analysis", " Download Lollipop graphic (.svg)" and "Download technical report" to obtain analysis files.
